#+TITLE: Deforestation

* autoregressive model (temporal correction)
** use trigonometric functions to correct for seasonality (can figure this out later)
** workflow suggestion:
*** simulate the data how I think it was generated, fake mean of deforest vs forest, fake flow
*** pull values from this dataset
