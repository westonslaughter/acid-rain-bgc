#+TITLE: Acidrain

* Summary
this project looks into element dynamics in the Hubbard Brook experimental forest in New Hampshire, particularly as these dynamics relate to site histories of experimental deforestation.

* TODO questions [0/5] :acidrain:
1. [ ] are there changes in Ca:Element ratios with flow?
2. [ ] do these ratios and ratio:Q relationships differ between deforested and forested watersheds?
3. [ ] have they changed over time?
4. [ ] calculate the total difference in yield between the deforested watersheds and watershed 6
   A. for each element in [Ca, Si, Na, Cl, K]
      a. by year
      b. entire record
5. [ ] look at the ratios above for all possible molar ratios
   A. average annual VWC
   B. total annual flux
6. [ ] C:Q and Ratio:Q relationships by decades since harvest
